# SampleCodes
This folder contains several sample codes for deep learning and machine learning problems.

1) Classifiers: contains two files that applies classical binary classifiers including k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, neural network, XGBoost and SVM
   from sklearn package to heart disease and blood samples datasets.

2) MachineLearningAlgorithmsScratch: contains sample files that implement different machine learning algorithms from scratch.
   It includes neural network algorithm that solves any general neural network problem using gradient descent method.
   It includes kmeans algorithm both in Python and Javascript.

3) Malaria_image_classifier: contains files that read malaria images inculding parasite and unparasite images. It applies convolutional neural network to image dataset.
   It classifies images with 93% accuracy.
   
4) NLP_sentiment_analysis: contains files that applies sentiment analysis to imdb and drug review datasets.

5) image_classifier_1: contains files that applies multiclass classification using AlexNet on image dataset including persian numeric, mnist, cfar10, ... datasets.

6) timeseriesprediction: contains files that predicts timeseries. It predicts timeseries using (1) deep neural network and (2) Reccurent neural network (RNN).
   It contains pipeline file that prepares the sequence to feed into the deep neural network and RNN.
   The merge pipeline file merges two sequences to feed simultaneously into the deep neural network and RNN to consider the prediction based on multiple input signals.
